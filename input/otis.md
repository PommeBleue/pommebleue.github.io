## {{ hl("excerpts", "The OTIS Excerpts") }}

Around the start of 2019, I posted publicly a
[collection of 192 problems and solutions](excerpts.html)
based on materials for OTIS.
This mini-book was named _The OTIS Excerpts_.
It is designed to mostly be beginner-friendly
though some of the chapters are more challenging.

# {{ hl("apply", "Application &mdash; Year IX (2023-2024)") }}

You may now apply for OTIS 2023-2024. The deadline is **August 1, 2023**.

- [Application instructions and homework for fall 2023](upload/otis-app-ix.pdf)
- [Submission URL for fall 2023](https://forms.gle/uCpRSiNow7GXj4if8)
- [Financial aid request URL for fall 2023](https://forms.gle/jPmWaqAvAavKSAkYA)

## {{ hl("prereq", "Who can apply") }}

OTIS is open to anyone, including international students from all countries.
Students from minorities and underrepresented groups
are especially encouraged to apply. (I promise I don't bite.)
Full financial aid is available for all applications
(even late) and admissions is need-blind.

Admissions are only done to ensure students have sufficient mathematical
background and writing ability (due to sheer number of students,
there is no "grading"), understand English,
and are able to learn from Evan-style writing.
In particular, **admissions is not a merit-based competition**.
See the application PDF for more details.
