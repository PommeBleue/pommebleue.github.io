This document describes the specifications requested by Evan
for any LaTeX source code that is sent to him.
Of course, others should feel free to use or adopt it freely.

## Keywords

The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
"OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
[RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119).

## Requirements

1. Source lines MUST be wrapped to be at most 100 characters long,
   and SHOULD be wrapped to at most 80 characters long,
   except in situations where this is impossible (e.g. long URL).
   (Note this is referring to lines in the _source code_, not the output.)
   When possible, line breaks SHOULD be inserted in natural places
   like the end of sentences, after commas, or between phrases and clauses.

2. Quotation marks MUST be
   [inputted correctly in LaTeX](https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/621924/76888).
   You MUST NOT type a literal quotation mark `"`.

3. Operators like `\sin` MUST be typeset correctly,
   either using builtin commands or using the `\operatorname` command.

4. Ellipses MUST be written with `\dots` unless the auto-detection would cause
   the wrong type of ellipses to be used; in that case, either `\cdots` or
   `\ldots` MUST be used instead.

5. Grammatical commas and grammatical periods MUST NOT appear in inline math.
   For example:

   - `Thus $x=3.$` is not acceptable and MUST be typeset as `Thus $x=3$.`
     instead.
   - `$a,b,$ and $c$` is not acceptable
     and MUST be typeset as `$a$, $b$, and $c$` instead.
   - `Let $x_1, \dots, x_n$ be integers` is not acceptable
     and MUST be typeset as `Let $x_1$, \dots, $x_n$ be integers` instead.

   Obviously, mathematical commas like those in `$f(a,b)$` and `$\{a,b,c\}$`
   should still be in the dollar signs.
   This applies only to grammatical commas.

6. There MUST NOT be extraneous spaces preceding punctuation
   or around dollar signs.
   Using two spaces after a sentence is OPTIONAL.

7. There SHOULD generally be spaces around binary operators
   and relations such as `+` or `=`,
   but these spaces MAY be omitted for short expressions.
   The use of spacing MUST be symmetric, e.g. `$x =3$` is not acceptable.

8. Delimiters of complex expressions SHOULD be balanced
   with `\left` and `\right`, or variants of `\big`.

9. Approximations of predefined operators MUST NOT be used.
   This means `||` MUST NOT be used in place of `\parallel`,
   or `.` in place of `\cdot`, etc.

10. For single-line display math, double dollar signs MUST NOT ever be used;
    the use of `\[ ... \]` instead is REQUIRED.
    Inserting newlines after `\[` and before `\]` is OPTIONAL;
    if the newline is not included there MUST be a space instead.
    There SHOULD be single newlines before and after displayed expressions;
    but there MUST NOT be double newlines unless it is intentional
    that the displayed line should be its own paragraph
    (which is almost never the case).

11. When a series of equation are too long to fit on a new line,
    one MUST NOT have adjacent `\[ ... \]` expressions.
    In most cases, the `align*` environment SHOULD be used instead.

12. When using `align*`, the invocations
    `\begin{align*}` and `\end{align*}` MUST be on their own line.
    There MUST be a new line after each `\\` newline.
    There MAY be additional newlines for legibility,
    and there MUST be additional newlines if they are necessary to keep
    the line length within the specified limit.

13. The contents of any `\begin{...} ... \end{...}` environment
    SHOULD be indented by at least two spaces.

14. There must not be any trailing whitespace,
    i.e. no line may end with a whitespace character.

15. Paragraph breaks MUST be typeset using two or more newlines,
    and MUST NOT be typeset using `\\\\` or other similar antics.

16. Any mathematical variables MUST be enclosed in dollar signs,
    e.g. `let n=2022` is not acceptable and MUST be typeset as `let $n=2022$`.
    This also includes constants like 1 used in a mathematical context,
    e.g. `add 1 to both sides` is not acceptable and MUST be typeset as
    `add $1$ to both sides`.

17. When specifying domains and ranges of mathematical functions,
    use `\colon` instead of `:`, e.g. `$f \colon \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$`.

## Example

The following is a solution to
[AIME II 2022 Problem 13](https://aops.com/community/p24447196).

```latex
Expand the generating function and take mod $x^{2023}$
to find that $P(x)$ is given by
\begin{align*}
  (-1)^{11-4} \cdot &(1+x^{30}+x^{60}+\cdots)
  \cdot (1+x^{42}+x^{84}+\cdots) \\
  \cdot &(1+x^{70}+x^{140}+\cdots)
  \cdot (1+x^{105}+x^{210}+\cdots).
\end{align*}
So it is equivalent to find the number of quadruples of
nonnegative integers $(a,b,c,d)$ which satisfy
\[ 105a + 70b + 42c + 30d = 2022. \]
By considering modulo $2$, $3$, $5$, $7$ we obtain
\begin{align*}
  a &\equiv 0 \pmod 2 \\
  b &\equiv 0 \pmod 3 \\
  c &\equiv 42^{-1} \cdot 2022 \equiv 1 \pmod 5 \\
  d &\equiv 30^{-1} \cdot 2022 \equiv 3 \pmod 7.
\end{align*}
Now set $a = 2w$, $b = 3x$, $c = 5y+1$, $d = 7z+3$;
the given equation rewrites as
\begin{align*}
  2022 &= 105(2w) + 70(3x) + 42(5y+1) + 30(7z+3) \\
  &= 210(w+x+y+z) + 132 \\
  \iff 9 &= w+x+y+z.
\end{align*}
By balls-and-urns the answer is $\binom{9+3}{3} = 220$.
```
