This page contains a list of referrals for
math competition training at various levels.
They are divided into two categories:

- Small programs offering either 1:1 instruction or small group lessons; and
- Individuals offering 1:1 instruction.

The lists below are in alphabetical order.
Larger programs (not in the categories above) are not included in this list.
The descriptions are provided by the individuals, not by me.

Suggestions for additions to this list (including self-nominations)
are welcome; send these by email.

## {{ hl("alex", "Alex Villaro Kr√ºger") }}

- Contact: $\text{alex}@\text{drechslerspil}{.}\text{dk}$
- 1:1 instruction
- I'm interested in tutoring one on one with students who are interested in
  olympiads and in exploring problems over a longer time (for instance problems
  leading to existing theory). I study mathematics in Moscow, but I am from
  Denmark where I have taken initiative to Nordic participation in
  [RMM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanian_Master_of_Mathematics_and_Sciences),
  among other things. However, I do not have personal experience in US specific
  olympiads such as AIME.

## {{ hl("raghav", "Raghav Aggarwal") }}

- Contact: $\text{raghavaggarwal2005}@\text{gmail}{.}\text{com}$
- Open to both 1:1 and group lessons.
- Raghav has the expertise to create very strong fundamentals in
  problem-solving. He runs lesson for students (of any origin) preparing for
  both computational exams (MathCounts, AMCs, AIME etc.) and proof-based
  olympiads. He is also open to any specific topic-teaching in math. He has a
  very unique set of teaching skills which any student always dreamt of!
