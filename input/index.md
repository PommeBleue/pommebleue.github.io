This is the homepage of Evan Chen (陳誼廷),
known also as `vEnhance` on many websites.
I'm an [MIT grad student](https://math.mit.edu/directory/profile.html?pid=2106)
under [Wei Zhang](https://math.mit.edu/~wz2113/),
and also a math olympiad [coach](otis.html),
[volunteer](volunteer.html), and
[YouTuber](https://www.youtube.com/c/vEnhance) on the side.

In the boring real world,
my research interests are in number theory and combinatorics.
You can [download my CV](upload/public-CV.pdf),
see my [publications](publications.html)
and [research](https://arxiv.org/a/chen_e_2.html),
or [read my university transcript](upload/math-coursework.pdf).

I am on [GitHub](https://github.com/vEnhance/),
[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/evanchen.cc/),
[Twitch](https://twitch.tv/vEnhance),
and [WordPress](https://blog.evanchen.cc).
You can also see my [personal page](personal.html) for trivia about myself.
Fellow Linux geeks can download my [GPG key][gpg] from [ubuntu][ubuntu-key],

If you are a high school student interested in math olympiads,
you may visit the [beginner's page](wherestart.html),

or my [archive of past problems and solutions](problems.html).

## {{ hl("about", "About Evan") }}

Evan is a math PhD student at MIT
and one of the United States math olympiad coaches.
In addition to serving as the team selection coordinator for the United States,
Evan runs his own [training program](otis.html) while
[streaming olympiad math for public entertainment](videos.html).

As a high school student, Evan was an IMO gold medalist
and a winner of the 2014 USA math olympiad,
which he took from 12:30am to 5am in Taiwan.
He also wrote the popular textbook
[Euclidean Geometry in Math Olympiads](geombook.html) while in high school,
which was published in 2016.

Outside of math and teaching, Evan's hobbies include
Korean pop dance, [Arch Linux, Hanabi and puzzle hunts](personal.html).
